Microsoft's Movie Studio

This repository contains the code and materials for the Microsoft's Movie Studio project, part of the curriculum for the Data Science Career Track by Flatiron School.

Project Overview
Microsoft wants to enter the movie industry and they want to know what types of films have been successful at the box office. They have asked us to use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for their new movie studio. The goal of this project is to analyze the data from five different sources and provide Microsoft's head of the movie studio with actionable insights.

Business Understanding
Stakeholders
The stakeholders in this project are Microsoft's head of the movie studio.

Key Business Questions
The business questions that this project will address are:

What types of films are currently performing best at the box office?
Which production companies produce the most successful films?
How do different genres perform in different regions?
Data Understanding and Analysis
The data for this project was obtained from five different sources:

Box Office Mojo
IMDB
Rotten Tomatoes
TheMovieDB
The Numbers
Because the data was collected from various locations, the different files have different formats. Some are compressed CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values) files that can be opened using spreadsheet software or pd.read_csv, while the data from IMDB is located in a SQLite database.

In the Jupyter Notebook you will find a detailed analysis of the data, including data cleaning and transformation, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations. We recommend that you start by reading the notebook.

The analysis yielded three concrete business recommendations, which we present below.

Visualizations
We selected three visualizations that correspond to our business recommendations. You can find them in the Visualizations folder.

Visualization 1

This visualization shows the distribution of profits by genre. It is clear from this chart that the most profitable genres are adventure, sci-fi, and action. These genres are good choices for Microsoft's new movie studio.

Visualization 2
visualization2

This visualization shows the distribution of profits by production company. The chart is sorted by total profit. We can see that Warner Bros. is the most profitable production company. Microsoft should consider partnering with Warner Bros. for its new movie studio.

Visualization 3

This visualization shows the distribution of profits by region and genre. We can see that different genres perform differently in different regions. For example, adventure movies are more popular in the US and Canada, while drama movies are more popular in the UK. Microsoft should consider these regional differences when deciding what types of films to produce.

Conclusion
In this project, we analyzed data from five different sources to generate insights for Microsoft's new movie studio. We presented three concrete business recommendations based on our analysis:

Microsoft should focus on producing adventure, sci-fi, and action movies.
Microsoft should consider partnering with Warner Bros. for its new movie studio.
Microsoft should consider regional differences when deciding what types of films to produce.
Microsoft can use these recommendations to help them decide what types of films to create.
